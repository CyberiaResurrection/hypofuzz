# Meeting, 2020-10-08

Initial meeting with Michael Papandrea (principal) and Gianmarco Senatore (client services),
the accountant who Clive recommended.


They were very impressed by the precis - clearly much better planning than most prospective
clients.  That does make me a little more confident in the inside-view of why this
would work well; it's an atypically good business to be in.



See PDF document for the company structure notes which Michael sketched out.
Comments on the diagrams:

- Most of the page is "option 1", a more complicated company structure which
  splits up the operating entity, IP holding company, and (family) trust which
  owns the whole thing.  This is more expensive (~7k) to set up but has some
  extra insulation in that the operating entity can fold and be replaced if sued.
  The family trust would also allow for spreading of income, but [my comment]
  probably not worth it as I'm not partnered and have no kids.

- Option 2, just a pty ltd, is simpler.  TBH I get most of the benefits anyway
  by holding the IP personally; if sued I can let the company fold and start
  a new one.

We'll need a lawyer in to look at the subscriber agreement and possibly IP
arrangements.

I should consider an advisory board too.

Michael was thinking about diversifying the line of business much harder than
I'm inclined to; I'd be thinking about growth via more effectively exploiting
the niche and growing the niche as much as possible.  Plus other languages!


# Follow-up email, 2020-10-09

I've sent them some basic information to add me to their systems as an individual
customer, and get started on company formation.  That includes notifying that
David is not formally involved at this stage.
