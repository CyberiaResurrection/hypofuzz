# Calling lawyers and insurance brokers


Gianmarco Senatore:
    Here are our recommended insurers:
    Brindabella Insurance Brokers:
    Frank Pazios <Frank@brindabellainsurance.com.au>
    (p) 02 6287 3933

    Allinsure:
    Peter Chamberlain peter@allinsure.com.au
    (p) 02 6131 9700

    Lawyers:
    Aulich Lawyers
    Erin Taylor <erin@aulich.com.au>
    (p) 02 6279 4222


Called Aulich Lawyers; they'll get back to me likely first thing tomorrow (and did)

probably don't need anything custom on the privacy policy since I'm not collecting
personal information under the Privacy Act.

Subscriber agreement will be $1500 plus GST; I'll email Erin with the details of
the company and what I need in the agreement


Called Frank; Adrian is the person to talk to
    will probably need workers comp as well as the others?
    TODO: follow up on this

From Gianmarco: likely to need business insurance, maybe professional liability,
probably not directors


Called Peter at AllInsure.
    Workers comp is mandatory; 0.2% * salary (call that 100K for the year);
    but in practice a ~700-800 dollar minimum for the policy

    Main policy is "IT liability" - combined professional indemnity and
    public liability insurance.  A 'just the piece of paper' policy is ~800;
    something useful starts at $1200-1500 or upwards.

    Estimate annual cost 2-2.5K but I'll get an actual quote after he looks.
    I'll have an email from Jessica to get the info they need this evening.
