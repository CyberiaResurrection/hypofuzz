Gianmarco Senatore:
    Here are our recommended insurers:
    Brindabella Insurance Brokers:
    Frank Pazios <Frank@brindabellainsurance.com.au>
    (p) 02 6287 3933

    Allinsure:
    Peter Chamberlain peter@allinsure.com.au

    Lawyers:
    Aulich Lawyers
    Erin Taylor <erin@aulich.com.au>
    (p) 02 6279 4222


Called Aulich Lawyers; they'll get back to me likely first thing tomorrow (and did)

probably don't need anything custom on the privacy policy since I'm not collecting
personal information under the Privacy Act.

Subscriber agreement will be $1500 plus GST; I'll email Erin with the details of
the company and what I need in the agreement


Called Frank; Adrian is the person to talk to
    will probably need workers comp as well as the others?
    TODO: follow up on this

From Gianmarco: likely to need business insurance, maybe professional liability,
probably not directors
