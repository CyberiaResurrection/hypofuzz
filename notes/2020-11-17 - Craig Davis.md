Craig was early in unit testing and automated acceptance testing

interested in PBT and the concepts


Early in refactoring, worked with a dev who built a refactoring plugin for VS.
Was getting good traction, then MS added a basic tool to VS.
In hindsight could have kept competing.


When sending out multiple emails, do lots of conversations
first!  Don't say too much about about it; just ask if they
would want it.  "If that was a paid tool, how much do you
think it would be worth?"

Later, slowly build up and iterate on messaging.


#1 thing to do is actually talk to lots of active users
try to separate out into adopters or not.
who's easy; everyone else is a "no" to start with

The minimum pitch / resistable offer:
"this is all it does.  Do you want it now?"
(and if you want it, how much would you pay)


The pricing seems about right.


No free trials - money-back instead.


Some people never pay; try to segment out paying customers.

Lean on Hypothesis, not my personal brand.


Start to think about team: if it picks up, how / with who
do I create a team? depends on the shape of the oppourtunity


most common surprise: customer awareness and demand

customer support and business: can be trickier and
more intellectually demanding than expected.

customers might be willing to pay more than expected -
underpricing is pretty common for good products
(though overpricing is too)



Please get back in touch in the new year, or if things
start taking off!
