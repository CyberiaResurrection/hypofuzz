PM then voice chat on Discord
Started talking about the tagged-bytestring implementation in Hypothesis.
He's planning to copy the continuation-bit repr for lists instead of length-prefixed.

Use differential coverage frequencies to recommend improvements to the test or strategies

Insight: blackbox fuzzing is as good as greybox IF the generator is really well tuned


Coverage presentation ideas

Keep path coverage for inputs in the seed pool, solely to investigate what it's doing
This can help work out how to get a fuzzer unstuck.

Also showing the html coverage map for each input / for all inputs and tag each line
with which seed(s) executed it.

Ultimate goal: time-travelling debugger for each input in the seed pool


Investigate Redqueen-style tracking, e.g. "input matched against this regex pattern"
-> generate from that regex.  I don't think we can literally do that, but incorporating
known values works very well for interpreted languages.  Probably still skipping it
for HypoFuzz though.
