https://danluu.com/testing/ inspired me; this is a general chat call.
Hoping to learn about hardware verification, get some perspective.


website needs a lot of work
missing or unclear: what does it mean to fuzz a test suite - clarify up front


acquihire is a possibility


at centaur - thousand machines full time, many more tests than cores
a full run would take three months

most teams do unit testing; we did all chip-level tests and didn't have time
all integration tests with cache heirarchies


very hard to capture value when some is OSS - devs also don't want to pay for things.


Could easily give me an internship here (IIRC Twitter) or at any other large company.
Schemathesis is much more productisable.
