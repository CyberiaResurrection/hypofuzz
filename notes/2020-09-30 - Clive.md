Clive suggests a pty ltd.

Name need not be specific to the product; suggests ZHD Technologies
(doesn't need a trading-as either)


Do more research about price elasticity - how much will people pay?


Accounting software - Xero and Stripe is a good combination


if I need to talk through the accounting


Micheal Pappendrayer - on the Kingston foreshore
very capable business planner, CPA, runs ACT CPA tax division, etc.


when do I need professional advice and what should I be asking?

getting the structure right upfront is worthwhile.
I may need to set up a trust as well - so the company is owned by the trust,
to give me discretion over distributions.

will need a contract - to protect me and my IP from customers
invest in a simple and clear contract, so product is not pinchable

see Micheal sooner rather than later, and get a good contract lawyer

Mark Love - is with BAL - Bradley Allen Love; good contract lawyer but
will cost several thousand to walk in the door.  Based in Civic, University Avenue.


Also need to think about tax implications - getting the wrong structure and
changing is very expensive.
