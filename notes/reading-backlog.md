# Reading backlog

This note is a dumping point for papers that I might want to put into the literature review.


TODO: add section on notable PBT tools to literature review
Quickcheck was first
Hedgehog does rose-tree implementation (read up on that)
smallcheck does exhaustive testing
Rudy Matela's thesis for generalisation of failures
link to related ideas in grammar-based fuzzing (by e.g. Andreas Zeller)

model-based stateful testing needs some explication
contrast shrinking/reduction vs normalisation vs generalisation



investigate https://github.com/laike9m/Cyberbrain for observability



OneFuzz notes
- pivoting from a hacker bolton to part of developer tooling
- "everyone wants fuzzing, but also agrees it's hard and expensive in terms of engineer time"
- I should publish a table of fuzzing tasks and categorise which HypoFuzz does for you
