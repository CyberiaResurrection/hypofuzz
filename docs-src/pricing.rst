:pypi:`Hypothesis` is free and open-source software, and always will be.
It's proven itself invaluable for everyone - from students to high-school
teachers, astrophysicists to data scientists, web developers to systems
programmers, and even for hardware designers.

Hypofuzz builds on that success: if you have Hypothesis tests, Hypofuzz
gives you a fantastic way to spend CPU time - instead of engineering time -
to find bugs early in your development cycle.


Commercial licences
-------------------

You can `apply to join our closed beta from your corporate email address
<mailto:hypofuzz@zhd.dev?subject=Hypofuzz%20commercial%20licence%20enquiry>`__.


Non-commercial licences
-----------------------

While Hypofuzz might be overkill for most hobbyists, there are many open-source
projects using Hypothesis who could benefit from it - think :pypi:`Numpy`,
:pypi:`Pandas`, :pypi:`hyper-h2 <h2>`, :pypi:`Black`, and hundreds more.

If you would like to fuzz an open source project, please
`email me to discuss a free non-commercial licence

Consulting
----------

As a core developer of Hypothesis and sole author of Hypofuzz, Zac is
well-placed to consult on property-based testing or fuzzing - whether you're
implementing it for the first time or want expert review of a mature test suite.
He is also `a regular speaker at Python conferences <https://zhd.dev/talks/>`__,
and can deliver customised training sessions or talks for your team.
